# FatFinisher
## Description
Fat Finisher is a fun program I made for the Congressional App Challenge that tracks the calories gained from a specific serving from specific food items as well as tracks the calories lost from doing specific workouts for a specific amount of time. Fat Finisher can also track amount of calories lost by walking or biking to a specific destination from a specific place. I hope this app can help people track their weight and tackle obesity around the world!
